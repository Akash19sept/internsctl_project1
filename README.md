# internsctl_project1
Scenario There is a customer who came to you with a problem to have a custom linux
command for his operations. Your task is to understand the problem and create a linux
command via bash script as per the instructions.
Command name - internsctl
Command version - v0.1.0

Section A
1. I want a manual page of command so that I can see the full documentation of the command.
For example if you execute the command
man ls
as output we get the doc and usage guidelines. Similarly if I execute man internsctl I want
to see the manual of my command.
2. Each linux command has an option --help which helps the end user to understand the use
cases via examples. Similarly if I execute internsctl --help it should provide me the
necessary help

3. I want to see version of my command by executing
internsctl --version
